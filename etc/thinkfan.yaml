# thinkfan Example Config File
# ============================
#
# Please read the config manpage thinkfan.conf(5) before playing around with
# this.
#
# This is NOT a working config file that can just be copied. It is only meant
# to give a rough idea what can be done. In particular, don't copy & paste the
# fan speed config! Think about what you're doing.
#
# If you don't know what temperatures are right for your system, you should
# not be using thinkfan!

# Sensor Drivers and Temperature Inputs
# =====================================
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which sensors are specified here is significant when
# specifying the fan speeds further below!
#
# There are multiple ways in which a temperature input can be specified. An
# example for each is given below.
#
# The "correction:" and "optional:" keywords may be specified on any type of
# sensor.

sensors:
  # LM Sensors
  # ==========
  # Temperatures can be read directly from Linux drivers through the LM sensors.
  #
  # To configure this, install "lm-sensors" and "libsensors", then
  # run "sensors-detect", then run "sensors".
  # To build thinkfan from sources, you'll also need to install "libsensors-dev"
  # or equivalent package for your distribution.
  #

  # hwmon: Full path to a temperature file (single sensor).
  # =======================================================
  # Disadvantage is that the index in "hwmon0" depends on the load order of
  # the driver modules, which may change across bootups on some systems.
  - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input
  # tpacpi: Legacy interface to the thinkpad_acpi driver
  # ====================================================
  # Particularly on older Thinkpad laptops, this interface may give access to
  # 8-16 temperature sensors, but it may be hard to tell where/what exactly
  # they measure.
  # Some documentation for older models may be found at the thinkpad wiki:
  # https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors
  #
  # Note that the hwmon interface is to be preferred nowadays.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.
#
fans:
  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared against these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
#
levels:
  - [0, 0, 55]
  - [1, 48, 60]
